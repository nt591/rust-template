# Introduction

This repo serves as a basic template for a Rust project.

## Prerequisites

Assumes you have an installation of the Rust toolchain available.
See the [website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) for installation.

## Configuration

The template supplies a CircleCI config file to run static analysis and linting
for each branch. It also runs tests via `cargo test`. See `src/calculator.rs` for a
sample of Rust tests, where unit tests are in their own module within the code
you're testing.
